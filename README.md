# React_AI_Application - Simplify Article Reading with GPT-4 Summarization

This App is an open-source web application that simplifies article reading by generating clear and concise summaries of lengthy articles using OpenAI's GPT-4 language model.

## Project Overview

- **Demo Component**: The `Demo` component allows users to input a URL, triggering the article summarization process.
- **Hero Component**: The `Hero` component displays the application's branding and a brief description.
- **Redux Setup**: Utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management and includes an API slice for handling article-related actions.

## How it Works

1. The user provides a URL of the article they want to summarize using the `Demo` component.
2. The URL is sent to the backend, where the article is fetched and processed.
3. The backend uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a summarized version of the article.
4. The summarized article is returned to the front end and displayed to the user.
